# Employee List

## Introduction

These instructions walk you through the creation of the Employee List dataset.

## Build the Query

First, move to the **Employee** branch. Expand it, then drag **Employee** to the query window.

Note that for this dataset we won't be using a measure. All we need is a simple list of all the employees in the cube. We will use this as a filter selection in one of the reports.

Click the **Click to execute the query** link to ensure the query runs without issues.
