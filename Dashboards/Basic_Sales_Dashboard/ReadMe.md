# Basic Sales Dashboard

This folder contains the instructions for creating the "basic" Sales Dashboard.

## File Layout

These instructions will be broken down into smaller files that will focus on various aspects of building a report. Each file is prefixed with a number, indicating the order in which the steps should be done.

In part 1, you will see how to constructing the basic report, placing the controls onto the report designer itself.

In the next step, you'll see how to add the data we'll need to the report.

In part 3, you'll learn how to bind our newly added data to the elements in the report.

With part 4 you'll go through the report cleanup process, applying good labels and formatting to the dashboard.

In part 5 and 6 you'll see how to build the mobile versions of the report. Part 5 will be the tablet based dashboard, and part 6 will be for the phone.

## Basic vs. Advanced

Be aware the terms _Basic_ and _Advanced_ are terms I am using for this course. They are not used by Microsoft.

The basic dashboard will use the simple set of tools to create a dashboard.

In the advanced report we'll use more advanced concepts such as linking elements together and adding filters to the dashboard to limit the data that is returned.

## Conclusion

Let's get started, proceed to the first set of instructions, found in the file [01-Building_the_Dashboard.md](01-Building_the_Dashboard.md)
