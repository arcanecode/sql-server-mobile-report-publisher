# State List

## Introduction

These instructions walk you through the creation of the State List dataset.

## Build the Query

First, move to the **City** branch. Expand it, then drag **State Province** to the query window.

Note that for this dataset we won't be using a measure. All we need is a simple list of all the States in the cube. We will use this as a filter selection in one of the reports.

Click the **Click to execute the query** link to ensure the query runs without issues.
