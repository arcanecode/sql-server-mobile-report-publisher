# Basic Sales Dashboard - Adding data

## Introduction

If you still have the Sales Dashboard open in the Mobile Report designer, great you are ready to proceed.

If not, return to your Report Portal and find the Sales Dashboard. (If you saved it in the previous set of steps then closed the designer, you may have to do a refresh on the Report Portal web page to make it appear.)

Find the Sales Dashboard, and click on the three dots in the upper right. This will cause a menu to appear. In it pick Edit in Mobile Report Publisher.
