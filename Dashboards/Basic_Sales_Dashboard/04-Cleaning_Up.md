# Cleaning Up the Dashboard

In this section we'll go through the various elements on the dashboard, as well as the dashboard itself, and add the finishing touches to make it look like a completed, professional report.

First, you obviously need the report open in Mobile Report Publisher. Then make sure you are on the _Layout_ tab.

If you've not done so, click in the top area and rename the report to **Sales Dashboard**.

## Category Chart

Click on the Category Chart report element. At the bottom you will see the properties for this element.

Change the title to **Sales by Year**.

One other optional change that may be useful to this report. By default the chart's Y axis starts at 0. Since we are dealing such large values, it may be useful to start the Y with a higher value. This will make it easier to see variations between years.

To do so, click the _Adjust Y range to values_ slider. You should see the chart element update with a higher Y axis.

## Bullet Graph

Next, click the Bullet graph to edit its properties. Start with the Title, setting it to **Sales YTD**.

Now move to the Subtitle right below it, and enter **vs Previous YTD**.

Do the set ranges thing for demo...
