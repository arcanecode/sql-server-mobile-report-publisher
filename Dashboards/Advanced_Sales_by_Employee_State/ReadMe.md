# Advanced Sales by Employee State Dashboard

## Introduction

This folder contains the instructions for creating the "advanced" Sales by Employee State dashboard.

 Be aware that the term "advanced" is used for this class, to differentiate it from the first report we created. This report will add filtering.

Also, since a lot of the basic steps were already covered during the creation of the basic report, we will abbreviate them here for brevity.

## Building te Advanced Report

With this report, we will be doing things in a different order to show the flexibility of the Mobile Report Publisher. We'll begin by adding the datasets first. Often a user will know what data they want for a report, but haven't thought out how they want it designed.

We will then move on to building the dashboard, and linking the report elements to the data.

Finally we will create the tablet and phone versions of the report and apply color themes.

## Conclusion

With that overview out of the way, let's get started.
