# Introduction to the SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher

## Introduction

This repository has the sample files for my Pluralsight course, Introduction to the SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher. You can find it, along with my other courses, at [https://www.pluralsight.com/search?q=robert%20cain](https://www.pluralsight.com/search?q=robert%20cain).

## Overview

The Mobile Report Publisher is a powerful tool lets you quickly and easily create reports for not just the web, but for a variety of platforms such as Apple’s iOS and Android.

In this course we’ll tell the story of Michelle, a fictional sales manager who needs dashboards to support her organization. These dashboards will need to run on the web, as well as on mobile platforms.

Fortunately for Michelle, the Mobile Report Publisher will meet her needs. Students in this course will see how to use the SQL Server Mobile Report Publisher to fulfill her list of requirements.

They’ll be guided on how to create dashboards using two methodologies, how to create datasets, and how to publish those reports to their SQL Server Reporting Services portal so they can be accessed from the web as well as mobile devices.

## Course Details

In this course we will work with the fictional sales manager for the Wide World Importers corporation. The sales manager, who we will call Michelle, has come to us with a need for dashboards to support a new marketing campaign.

In the initial interview, Michelle will explain she needs the dashboards available via web pages to support the corporate office. At the same time, the sales team is spread across the world and will need to check the dashboards on their mobile devices such as cellular phones and tablets including iPad and Android tablets.

We’ll explain to the viewer that based on these criteria the tool of choice will be Mobile Report Publisher.

In a subsequent module we will again interview our fictional sales manager. The series of questions and answers will be used to demonstrate how the Report Publisher can be used to create layouts quickly and easily. This is referred to as the “design first” approach.

We’ll let Michelle go, then do the work of gathering data and binding it to the report, then show her the finished result.

In the next set of examples, we will show a second method for developing a report. Michelle will have sent us a list of data she needs on a new dashboard, which the viewer and I will create datasets for. 

With the data now available, we’ll bring our fictional sales manager back to help us design the new dashboard, demonstrating the “data first” method for building dashboard in Mobile Report Publisher.

The course will wrap up by showing both Michelle and the viewers what the reports look like when executed on the web, as well as on a cell phone and tablet.
