# RSD Files

This folder contains the RSD files for each dataset. Instead of creating each dataset, you could upload them to the report portal.

Just use the Upload button in the toolbar, select the RSD file, and it should appear. Note if you use a different server than localhost you'll need to edit each dataset to set the correct connection string.

Note that you will not be able to open the RSD file in VSCode or any tool other than Report Builder.
